<div id="intro-header"> What is anonymity? </div>
<div id="introduction"> <br> <br> <br> <br> Anonymity, especially online, is prone to becoming topic of debate- but what is it? <br>Anonymity is the concept of keeping people or persons anonymous, or the presence of <br> a means to providing complete privacy and total facelessness. The concept of anonymity <br> on the internet is problematic, as while it provides great benefits, it can also serve <br> as a means in which poor behavior, which generally would not be accepted in society, <br> becomes shameless and without consequence. To be able to speak one's mind without fear <br> of social reprocussions is powerful. No other saying is more relevant in this case <br> than that which goes "give a man a mask and he'll show his true face".<br> <br> <br> <br> Online harrassment, sometimes referred to as "cyberbullying", is a common driver for <br> anti-anonymity thought. All too often, we see people, who are often vulnerable, subjected <br> to this cruel sort of harrassment. Remarks about appearence, controversy, race or ethnic <br> background, political beliefs, etc... are both nasty and common sights on the internet. <br> There is a belief that this generally occurs on social media and amongst youth, but in <br> reality, it's not uncommon to see fully grown adults attacking each other from behind <br> their screens. Aside from being incredibly childish and rude, real harm can come from this. <br> All too often we hear stories of people that commit self-harm, or in some extreme cases, <br> suicide, as a result of being victim to cyber-bullying.<div id="faceless1"> </div> </div> </div>
